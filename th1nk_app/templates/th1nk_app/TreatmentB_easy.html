            This exercise is about database-compliant data records.
            Such a data record has to satisfy the following requirements to be database compliant:
            <ul>
                <li>Every column is a variable</li>
                <li>Every row is an observation</li>
                <li>Every cell is a single value</li>
            </ul>
        </h4>
        <h4>For example this table satisfy all requirements:</h4>

    </div>


   <h2>Let's start with the first task:</h2>
   <h4>
   In this exercise, you will prepare a small dataset for analysis. 
   Your goal is to make sure the data is structured in a way that a computer can understand and use for visualization or further calculations. 
   The dataset contains a header that is not fully database-compliant, which means it may be organized in a nested way that needs adjustment. 
   You can solve this task using Excel, pen & paper, whatever method works best for you.
   Focus on observing the data carefully, as this will help you answer the following questions.

   <h4>Here is a small snippet of the data.</h4>

   <h4>Step 1: Download the file <a href="{% static 'data/city_data.xlsx' %}" download>city_data.xlsx</a>.</h4>
   <h4>Step 2: Examine the dataset and make any adjustments necessary to make it database-compliant.</h4>
   <h4>Step 3: Once you have structured the data correctly, answer the following questions based on your result.</h4>
