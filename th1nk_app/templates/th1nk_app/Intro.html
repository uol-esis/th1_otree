    On the next pages you will find two tasks, each consisting of a dataset and a collection of questions.
    Your goal is to prepare the data so that it is properly structured for analysis.
    You will earn points for correctly completing each task, which will be converted into a monetary bonus at the end.
    Careful work is therefore rewarded.
    Please answer to the best of your knowledge.

            This exercise is about database-compliant data records.
            Such a data record has to satisfy the following requirements to be database compliant:
            <ul>
                <li>Every column is a variable</li>
                <li>Every row is an observation</li>
                <li>Every cell is a single value</li>
            </ul>
        </h4>
        <h4>For example this table satisfy all requirements:</h4>

    <h2>Video Tutorial</h2>
    <h4>This short video explains how to use the software tool you will need for completing the next steps of your task.
    The tool allows you to upload a dataset, preview it in a database-compliant format, and apply simple transformations if needed.
    For the first task, the tool can automatically restructure the data; for the second task, you might need to make minor adjustments using its functions.
    Focus on observing the preview table carefully, as this will help you answer the questions afterwards.</h4>
